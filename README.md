# Mind Analytics Project – Speed Dating RMarkdown Analysis

This project analyzes psychological and behavioral predictors of romantic interest using the **speed dating dataset**. It was developed as a comprehensive, expert-oriented RMarkdown report applying key data science concepts including factor analysis, regression modeling, reliability metrics, and ethical evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Research Goal

To understand what factors influence whether someone says “yes” to a speed date and how self-perception, gender, and personality ratings shape those decisions.

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

- Source: [Speed Dating Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment)  
- Observations: ~8,000 dates between 2002–2004  
- Includes: trait ratings, match decisions, self/partner perceptions, and demographics  
- Cleaned, subsetted, and modeled using R (tidyverse, psych, lme4, ggeffects, corrplot)

## 📈 Key Questions Answered

1. How do interests cluster together across individuals?
2. Which EFA model best reveals latent personality traits?
3. Does attractiveness predict match decisions?
4. Are men and women influenced by different traits?
5. Do people see themselves the same way others see them?
6. What combination of traits predicts “yes” responses?
7. How does multilevel modeling account for repeated decisions?
